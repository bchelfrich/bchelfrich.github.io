                    Six Phases of <span>Incedent Response</span>
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is a field that is important to pretty much every industry. A good cybersecurity system can help 
                    businesses stay safe from cybercrimes such as phishing attacks, malware attacks, and ransomware. Any organization 
                    that is serious about its cybersecurity should start with a good incident response plan. A cyber incident response 
                    plan tell a companyâ€™s IT & security professionals what to do in case of a cyber security incident like a data breach. 
                    A solid incident response generally consists of six phases: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, 
                    recovery, and lessons learned. <br /> <br />
                </p>
                <div class="subtitle">
                    <h2>Preparation</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Preparation is all about the events leading up to a cyber attack. In this phase, the company should ensure that all 
                    employees have a certain degree of awareness about cybersecurity and knowledge of basic incident response techniques 
                    to deal with a cyber crisis.
                </p>
                <div class="subtitle">
                    <h2>Identification</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Identification is about identifying a breach and if any other systems have been compromised. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework 
                    suggests that you focus on answering questions such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who discovered the breach?</li>
                    <li>What is the extent of the breach?</li>
                    <li>What could be the source of the compromise? </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It is important that everything be documented in this phase.
                </p>
                <div class="subtitle">
                    <h2>Containment</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Containment involves everything a company can do to mitigate damage once there is already a cyber crisis. The company should 
                    consider the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which systems can be taken offline?</li>
                    <li>Can anything be deleted safely? Should it be deleted?</li>
                    <li>What is the short and long term strategy in dealing with the effects of the attack?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Backups should be reviewed along with checking if all relevant security updates have been applied.
                </p>
                <div class="subtitle">
                    <h2>Eradication</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Eradication is not just about dealing with the threat in real time, but understanding what caused the breach in the first place. 
                    This will involve patching vulnerabilities in the system, removing any malicious software, updating old software, etc. <br /> <br />
                    This is done to ensure that all malicious content is wiped clean from the compromised system, and if done properly, without losing 
                    important data in the process.
                </p>
                <div class="subtitle">
                    <h2>Recovery</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Recovery is all about getting the compromised systems back online after the incident. This phases is important as it tests, monitors, 
                    and verifies the affected systems and prevents similar incidents in the future.
                </p>
                <div class="subtitle">
                    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is perhaps the most important phase of the incident response plan where the company should assess what it can learn from the 
                    incident. The incident response team should meet no later that two weeks after the attack and discuss it. This is where the documentation 
                    in the identification phase comes into play. The team can look into the root of the breach and figure out how to prevent similar attacks 
                    in the future. <br /> <br />
                    It is all about learning from your mistakes in order to ensure that they do not happen again, and god forbid they do, they can be handled better.
