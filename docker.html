                    If you plan on going into cloud computing, heck even any I.T. role for that matter, you just have to know what a docker container is and what it does.
                    What is a docker container? Well, before we can define what a docker container actually is, we first have to understand what it is replacing. <br /><br />
                    A docker container is essentially replacing virtual machines. Usually, a single physical machine contains one base operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).
                    What if I wanted to use another OS? Before virtual machines, if you wanted to run two different operating systems, you would have to have two physical machines 
                    to run them. That's where virtualization comes in. <br /> <br /> 
                    Virtual machines are ran on something called a hypervisor (VMware). What hypervisors allow us to do is take a portion of our server's resources and dedicate it 
                    to a virtual machine or guest operating system. <br /> <br />
                    So what virtual machines do is essentially virtualize the hardware. What docker does is virtualize the entire operating system. Instead of using a hypervisor, 
                    you would have a single OS on top of the machine and then have docker installed over that. Here, docker basically does the same thing as the hypervisor except 
                    it virtualizes portions of the OS by creating containers. Like virtual machines, these containers can run their own operating system (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.). 
                    The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. <br /> <br />
                    Docker containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.
