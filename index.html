                    <p>
                        I am currently a student at Southeast Missouri State University, majoring in cybersecurity and minoring in computer networking.
                        My main interest is in system administration with a side focus in cloud computing and IaaS, but I am actively looking for ways to expand
                        my computer knowledge. <br /> <br /> I like to sharpen my coding skills with consistent mini projects and learn important concepts every day using online
                        platforms such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox. This learning journey has become an amazing hobby in itself. I am currently studying for the CompTIA
                        Security+ certification with future plans for the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner certification.

                                The term malware refers to harmful software that may disrupt or manipulate a computer’s normal operations.
                                Malware can infect any device that has computing capabilities; phones, tablets, personal PCs, company equipment, etc. <br /> <br />
                                Malware typically infects a machine by tricking a user to click into and/or install a program they shouldn't have from the internet. 
                                When the click or installation occurs, malicious code may execute damaging actions the user didn't anticipate or intend.

                                Cybersecurity is a field that is important to pretty much every industry. A good cybersecurity system can help businesses
                                stay safe from cybercrimes such as phishing attacks, malware attacks, and ransomware. Any organization that is serious about
                                its cybersecurity should start with a good incident response plan. A cyber incident response plan tell a company’s IT & security
                                professionals what to do in case of a cyber security incident like a data breach. A solid incident response generally consists of
                                six phases: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

                                What is Docker?
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                If you plan on going into cloud computing, heck even any I.T. role for that matter, you just have to know what a docker container is and what it does.
                                What is a docker container? Well, before we can define what a docker container actually is, we first have to understand what it is replacing. <br /><br />
                                A docker container is essentially replacing virtual machines. Usually, a single physical machine contains one base operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).
                                What if I wanted to use another OS? Before virtual machines, if you wanted to run two different operating systems, you would have to have two physical machines 
                                to run them. That's where virtualization comes in. <br /> <br /> 
                                Virtual machines are ran on something called a hypervisor (VMware). What hypervisors allow us to do is take a portion of our server's resources and dedicate it 
                                to a virtual machine or guest operating system. <br /> <br />
                                So what virtual machines do is essentially virtualize the hardware. What docker does is virtualize the entire operating system. Instead of using a hypervisor, 
                                you would have a single OS on top of the machine and then have docker installed over that. Here, docker basically does the same thing as the hypervisor except 
                                it virtualizes portions of the OS by creating containers. Like virtual machines, these containers can run their own operating system (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.). 
                                The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. <br /> <br />
                                Docker containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.

                            <p>
                                Phishing is an example of social engineering with a touch of spoofing. It is where an attacker sends a fraudulent message designed 
                                to trick a victim into falling for a scam. This typically involves stealing financial credentials or other sensitive information.
                                Phishing emails are common because it is easy, cheap, and effective. Email addresses are easy to obtain and emails are basically free
                                to send. With a little bit of research on the victim, attackers can quickly gain valuable data. Those who fall for these scams may end 
                                up with malware, most commonly ransomware, identity theft, and data loss. <br /> <br />
                                There are several different ways for cyber criminals to phish. When an attacker wants to target a whole group simultaneously, this is 
                                called pharming. The attacker can take over an entire DNS server or website, meaning everyone that accesses it will be redirected to the 
                                attacker's website, which may have malicious intent. Vishing (voice phishing) is done over the phone or voicemail. This includes caller i.d. spoofing and
                                fake security checks/bank updates. Smishing (SMS phishing) is done over text message. This can again include spoofing and usually provides
                                forward links for personal information. Spear phishing is where the attacker targets an individual inside the target organization who would 
                                have access to inside information. This is done by gathering information from third party websites, like social media. The attacker will then 
                                put together all useful information (friends, family, employment, banks, etc.). Spear phishinh the CEO of an organization is called whaling.
