                </h1>
                <p>
                    I recently came across an interesting post on LinkedIn covering a stealthy Linux threat that is targeting financial
                    insitutions in Latin America. The title of the article flashed "New Linux malware 'almost impossible' to detect," with 
                    researchers dubbing the threat "Symbiote" because of its parasitic nature. Of course, the Marvel fanboy in me was 
                    instantly intrigued by the name of the newfound threat. <br /> <br />
                    The malware was first discovered back in November, according to a blog post by BlackBerry Research. Symbiote, however, is 
                    different than other Linux malware given its approach to infecting running processes, rather using stand-alone executable files 
                    to inflict damage. It then harvests credentials to provide remote access for the attacker, exfiltrating the credentials as well 
                    as storing them locally. <br /> <br />
                    Joakim Kenneedy, a security researcher at Intezer and the author of the BlackBerry blog post exaplains the Symbiote a little more:
                    "It operates as a rootkit and hides its presence on the machine. Once it has infected the machine fully, it allows you to see only 
                    what it wants you to see. Essentially, you can't trust what the machine is telling you." <br /> <br />
